    "\n",
    "The first executable line of code is a `print` line to print a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next print statement, demonstrates a new concept, the idea that we can manually insert new lines. This is accomplished by **adding a backslash n (\\n) character inside of a string**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it'll print \"Physics\" by itself, and then a new line, and then \"Chemistry\", and then a new line, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen before, the `print` function inserts a new line by itself. It has an implicit new line at the end of every execution. So an extension of this is that if we want to print just a new line by itself, like a blank line, we can use the following:  `print \" \"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The next portion of code presents **format preserving multi-line strings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you were printing a poem, that maybe has a very specific structure -- maybe it's indented in certain places. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new lines are required in the right place for rhyming. You might use this triple quote -- quote quote quote -- to begin and end this string to preserve the white space, to preserve the new lines, and to preserve the indenting."
